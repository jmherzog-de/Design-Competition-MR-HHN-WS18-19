<p style="text-align: justify;">
The hardware used by the DaRRa robot has been optimized for the lowes possible power consumption due to severely limited energy guidelines (only 4 AA batteries permitted). A graphical overview of the power supply can be found in the section Power Supply.<br>
During construction, the focus was on realizing the required functionalities with as gew operating resources as possible. At the same time, however, the maximum flexibility shoubld be made possible in order to solbe these complex task.<br>
The following table provides an inital overview of all electrical equipment used in the project. Stating their equipment identification, so that they are easier to identify in the circuit diagram. There are also a complete circuit diagram in this repository.

The board has an L298-H-bridge with wich the motors of the main drive are controlled. This enables both a reversal of the direction and a speed adjustment.                                                                    |

# Power supply

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The entire energy supply is ensured by four AA batteries connected in series. The four 1.5 V AA batteries connected in series provides a total voltage of 6 V. However, this level drops significantly during operation. The battery voltage was connectoed to luster terminals and distributed to the individual electrical components.

| <img src="images/Vcc-Circuit.png"> | The ultrasonic sensors and the bluetooth module are supplied by the Arduino's internal voltage converter. The internal power supply on the Arduino board can be seen in the following picture. With the amplifier U5A and the voltage divider in front of it, each with 10 kÎ© resistors. They make it possible to connect higher voltage (see technical data sheet of the Arduino board) at the Arduino. For this reason the battery voltage is applied to the Vin pin. The voltage for the ultrasonic sensors is connected at the +5 V pin. The power supply for the bluetooth modul takes place at the +3.3 V pin.<br> |
